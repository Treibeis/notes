### Simulating realistic dwarf galaxies
`Alex Fitts`

- To big to fail: the densest subhalos around MW-size galaxies in simulations have no counterparts in local-Universe observations
- Baryon physics can alleviate the missing satellite problem, but cannot solve the core-cusp problem in small-scale structures ($M\lesssim 10^{10}\ M_{\odot}$)
- FIRE in the field, selected from a $35^{3}\ \mathrm{Mpc^{3}}$ box, mass resolution: $m_{gas}=500\ M_{\odot}$, $m_{DM}=2500\ M_{\odot}$, GIZMO with FIRE-2 feedback scheme
- strong correlation between mass assembly history and the present-day stellar mass
- bursty star formation
- increasing $M_{*}\rightarrow$ lower central density, no cores for halos with $M_{*}\lesssim 2\times 10^{6}\ M_{\odot}$
- The half-light radius marks the extent of density reduction due to baryonic effect.
- correlation between central density of the DM halo (determined by the assembly time!) and present-day stellar mass

- FIRE dwarfs still have the to-big-to-fail problem
- Mass assembly is delayed in WDM cosmology $\rightarrow$ lower stellar mass assembly and $M_{*}(z=0)$, but the central density may not be reduced!
- In WDM cosmology, there are dwarf galaxies only with young stellar populations.
- For SIDM, the mass assembly history is unchanged, but the central density is reduced

### Supernova-driven evolution of the first stars and galaxies
`Jeremy Ritter`

- [C/Fe]-[Fe/H]
- Jennifer Johnson, 2017
- $\alpha$ element enhancement at low metalicities
- Questions: link between SN yields and observed abundances in stars, when PopII stars form in the enriched ISM, inhomogenity in ejecta
- The first metal-enriched stars likely formed before complete homogenition of yields
- In ultra-faint dwarfs, can SN blow gas out of DM halos?
